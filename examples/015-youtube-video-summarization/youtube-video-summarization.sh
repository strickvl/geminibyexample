Thomas, the father, is sharing his son Max's story of having Alexander Disease, a rare ultra-rare genetic disorder. After having a difficult time conceiving and finally being successful and welcoming Max to their family, they were dealt a devastating blow when Max had his first seizure at a very young age. 

Because of the seizure, Max had to go through a series of medical tests. Those tests showed that Max had Alexander Disease. After doing some research, the family was heartbroken, as the typical life expectancy for this disease is 5-10 years, and there is no treatment or cure.

Thomas started researching more in-depth by summarizing scientific papers by using Gemini AI and has discovered a lead scientist and her team in New York that he connected with. He sends one to two emails a week to different scientists in order to get more studies underway for the disease. He doesn't want Max to be seen as having 'zero' chance and wants to be a dad and enjoy his time with Max. He will continue to strive to find a cure for Max!
