AI, or Artificial Intelligence, encompasses a range of techniques enabling machines to mimic human intelligence.

At a high level, AI systems learn from data. This learning process allows them to identify patterns, make predictions, and solve problems.

AI achieves this through algorithms, statistical models, and neural networks, which are inspired by the structure of the human brain.

These networks consist of interconnected nodes that process and transmit information, enabling AI to recognize images, understand language, and make decisions.

AI is continuously evolving, with new techniques and applications emerging regularly.
