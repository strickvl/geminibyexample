Cat Story:
 Whiskers twitched. Mittens, a calico of discerning taste, yawned. A rogue sunbeam, a daredevil, dared her to explore. 

She slipped out the cat flap. The garden, a verdant jungle! A beetle, a terrifying behemoth, scuttled past.  Mittens, a fearsome hunter, pounced!  The beetle escaped.  Defeated, but undeterred, she found a dandelion.  The adventure, glorious and dusty, was complete. She curled up, purring, in the sunbeam's warm embrace.
