## Basic Examples: Text

### Simple generation

```python
from google import genai
client = genai.Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", contents="Explain how AI works in a few words"
)
print(response.text)
```

```shell
$ pip install google-generative-ai
$ python basic-generation.py
AI works by learning patterns from data, then using those patterns to make predictions or generate new content. It processes information through neural networks that mimic human brain connections, identifying features and relationships to perform tasks like recognition, prediction, and generation.
```

### Values in Python

This example demonstrates the different value types in Python.

```python
print("Hello, World")
print("Hello with single quotes")
print(42)  # Integer
print(3.14159)  # Float
print(True)
print(False)
print(None)
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "four", 5.0]
print(my_list)
my_tuple = (1, 2, "three")
print(my_tuple)
my_dict = {"name": "Python", "version": 3.9}
print(my_dict)
```

```shell
$ python values.py
Hello, World
Hello with single quotes
42
3.14159
True
False
None
[1, 2, 3, 'four', 5.0]
(1, 2, 'three')
{'name': 'Python', 'version': 3.9}
$ python -c "print('Hello from Python!'); print(1 + 2)"
Hello from Python!
