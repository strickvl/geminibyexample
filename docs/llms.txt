## Basic Examples: Text

### Simple text generation

```python
from google import genai
client = genai.Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", contents="Explain how AI works in a few words"
)
print(response.text)
```

```shell
$ pip install google-generative-ai
$ python basic-generation.py
AI works by learning patterns from data, then using those patterns to make predictions or generate new content. It processes information through neural networks that mimic human brain connections, identifying features and relationships to perform tasks like recognition, prediction, and generation.
```

*This example includes images which can be viewed on the website.*

### Streaming Text Generation

This example demonstrates how to stream text when generating content using the Gemini API.

```python
from google import genai
client = genai.Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
response = client.models.generate_content_stream(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", contents=["Explain how AI works"]
)
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk.text, end="")
```

```shell
$ pip install google-generative-ai
$ python streaming_example.py
AI, or Artificial Intelligence, encompasses a range of techniques enabling machines to mimic human intelligence.
