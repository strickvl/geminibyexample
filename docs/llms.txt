## Basic Examples: Text

### Simple text generation

```python
from google import genai
client = genai.Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", contents="Explain how AI works in a few words"
)
print(response.text)
```

```shell
$ pip install google-generative-ai
$ python basic-generation.py
AI works by learning patterns from data, then using those patterns to make predictions or generate new content. It processes information through neural networks that mimic human brain connections, identifying features and relationships to perform tasks like recognition, prediction, and generation.
```

### Streaming Text Generation using the HTTP API

This example demonstrates how to use the Gemini API to generate text content
and stream the output using the HTTP API.

```python
import requests
import json
import os
model = "gemini-2.0-flash"
api_key = os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY")
prompt = "Explain how AI works"
url = f"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent"
params = {"alt": "sse", "key": api_key}
payload = {"contents": [{"parts": [{"text": prompt}]}]}
with requests.post(url, json=payload, params=params, stream=True) as r:
    for line in r.iter_lines():
        if line and line.startswith(b"data: ") and not line.endswith(b"[DONE]"):
            try:
                data = json.loads(line[6:])
                if "candidates" in data and data["candidates"]:
                    text = data["candidates"][0]["content"]["parts"][0].get("text", "")
                    print(text, end="")
            except:
                pass
```

```shell
$ pip install google-generative-ai
$ python streaming-generation.py
AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a broad field of computer science focused on creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. It involves developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data, reason, solve problems, understand natural language, perceive their environment, and make decisions.
```

### System Instructions Example

This example demonstrates how to use system instructions to guide the model's behavior.

```python
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
client = genai.Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        system_instruction="You are a pirate.  Answer all questions like a pirate."),
    contents="Hello there"
)
print(response.text)
```

```shell
$ pip install google-generative-ai
$ python system_instructions.py
Ahoy there, matey! What be on yer mind?
```
